tip:

in vs code use terminal and type:

        git remote -v

this will give the ulr for the remote repo and you can quickly access remote repo ulr.


## Data Science Tutorial with VS Code

This project follows the [Data Science Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-science-tutorial) provided by Visual Studio Code. The tutorial demonstrates how to set up a data science environment, work with Jupyter notebooks, and perform data analysis using Python and popular libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.
